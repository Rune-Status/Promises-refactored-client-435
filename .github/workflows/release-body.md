# Release notes

For your convenience, we provide Java `.jar` file builds that can connect to the [server](https://github.com/runejs/server).

## Instructions

To run the client, follow the steps in the [`README.md` file](https://github.com/runejs/refactored-client-435) - make sure to change the name of the `.jar` file to match your downloaded file name if needed:

```bash
java -jar path/to/your/downloaded/client-435-0.3.jar
```
